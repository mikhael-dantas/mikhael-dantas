# Mikhael Dantas

## Hi There ðŸ‘‹
Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and improve. I'm passionate about programming and I'm always looking for ways to advance. 

As a self-taught developer, I have been studying and practicing programming for 6 years. Part of my journey was dedicated to establishing a solid foundation in computer science and software development, understanding the best practices and patterns, as well as the most modern technologies and frameworks avaliable.

 <br/> :purple_heart: &nbsp; Currently working mostly on NodeJs frameworks, using Typescript as main choice.
 <br/> :blush: &nbsp; I can help with anything related to programming, solving problems or surpassing challenges. 
 <br/> :computer: &nbsp; You can see my complete skillset on my personal web page: [www.mikhaeldantas.com](https://www.mikhaeldantas.com/) 
 <br/> ðŸ’¬  &nbsp; More about me? I love logic, programming, gaming, science and technology, I would say I'm a curious person.
